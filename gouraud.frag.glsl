 * A simple Blinn-Phong shader with two light sources.
 * This file is the fragment shader which calculates
 * the halfway vector between the viewer and light source
 * vector and then calculates the color on the surface
 * given the material properties passed in from the CPU program.
 *
 * For more information see:
 *     <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinn–Phong_shading_model>

 *
 * Be aware that for this course, we are limiting ourselves to
 * GLSL v.1.2. This is not at all the contemporary shading
 * programming environment, but it offers the greatest degree
 * of compatability.
 *
 * Please do not use syntax from GLSL > 1.2 for any homework
 * submission.
